1. What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, the language of the Internet. It is the standard text formatting language used for creating and displaying pages on the Internet.

2. What are HTML tags?
We use HTML tags to place the elements in the proper and appropriate format. Tags use the symbols < and > to set them apart from the HTML content.

3. What are HTML Attributes?
Attributes are the properties that can be added to an HTML tag. These attributes change the way the tag behaves or is displayed. For example, a <img> tag has an src attribute, which you use to add the source from which the image should be displayed.

We add attributes right after the name of the HTML tag inside the brackets. We can only add the attributes to opening or self-closing tags but never to closing tags.

5. How do you separate a section of text in HTML?
We separate a section of text in HTML using the below tags:
<br> tag – It separates the line of text. It breaks the current line and shifts the flow of the text to a new line.
<p> tag–This tag is used to write a paragraph of text.

6. Define the list types in HTML.
The list types in HTML are as follows:

Ordered list–The ordered list uses <ol> tag and displays elements in a numbered format.
Unordered list–The unordered list uses <ul> tag and displays elements in a bulleted format.
Definition list–The definition list uses <dl>, <dt>, <dd> tags and displays
 elements in definition form like in a dictionary.
